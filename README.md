# TodoApp
The TodoApp is a simple application that allows a person to enter a number of activity they want to do and mark them as done or remove them from the list. The person can view the list of already completed activities and the ones not yet completed. I created this app as a practice to help me understand how  flask api works.

# To run the app

1. Download or clone this repository

2. Navigate to the main folder of this app

3. Then run the index.py file using the commands bellow

export FLASK_APP=index.py

flask run
